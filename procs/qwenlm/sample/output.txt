Sure, here's an implementation of the bubble sort algorithm in Python:

```python
def bubble_sort(array):
    n = len(array)
    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n):
        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if array[j] > array[j+1] :
                array[j], array[j+1] = array[j+1], array[j]
    return array
```

This algorithm takes an array as input and sorts it in ascending order. It works by repeatedly iterating through the array, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm repeats this process until the array is sorted.
