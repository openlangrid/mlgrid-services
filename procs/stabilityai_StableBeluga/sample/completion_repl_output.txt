### User: Write me a poem please

### Assistant:
 A poem for you I will weave,
So that your heart it will achieve.
Imagery I will create,
In every word that I do write.
Flowers will bloom, and skies will glow,
As if we're taken to a place we know.
Our souls will dance in harmony,
To show the beauty of the melody.
So come with me on a magical ride,
Where you can leave your worries behind.
