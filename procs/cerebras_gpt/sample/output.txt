Tell me about alpacas.

R.J. – Alpachas. The Alpaca, are they good for meat?
– I'm just being honest. They're one of the good food for us, because the meat it has a special taste and we can eat it. But they have a good meat because it's alpagas that have good quality. As for me I don't like alps. I like to eat white meat for my meat. Alps are very common in Mexico, but we don´t have them every day, like we have cow, pig and chicken. We use alphacapra, which is alfalfa in the U.S. It doesn't have any good and the price is high. Also the animal alpi, it produces alpes in a white color, so it is white alpa. Anyway, the alpetaur, is very good, we eat them raw, or we cook them a bit in vinegar (salsa). Now if we use it, he's just like raw alpe. However, I still like white, raw meat better than cooked. In the country I love raw food better. So I eat alpan. When we are in town, and at home they cook some food,
